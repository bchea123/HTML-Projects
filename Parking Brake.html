			The <strong>Parking Brake</strong>, also known as an Emergency Brake, is used to park a
			manual transmission vehicle. Unlike a vehicle with an automatic transmission, vehicles
			with a manual transmission do not have a parking gear. <br> <br>

			<p> To park a manual transmission, activate the parking brake by pulling upwards on the
			lever. <br> 
			<b>Note:</b> You can shift the <strong>Gear Box</strong> into any gear to ensure that the 
			transmission locks the driving wheels of the vehicle. This is best practice while parking
			on sloped hills to ensure the vehicle does not roll away. </p>
